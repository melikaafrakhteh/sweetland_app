# Sweetland
### Sweetland is a simple confectionery application in Persian.
#### I built this app a long time ago, but after learning clean Architecture, I decided to refactor it and also make it look better and add another feature to it.
#### Sweetland was written in Kotlin. In previous version, I used RxJava, MVVM, Room, Retrofit and Navigation Component.
#### In the second version, additionally, I used Dagger2, Kotlin Coroutines and MVI.
